[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opr/formality.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opr/formality)

#### A note to Users looking for the deprecated serialization library Formality
The above library has been superseded by [Surreal]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/surreal) and users looking for it should visit [Surreal]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/surreal).

# Installation 

Type `yarn install formality` on the command line.


# Usage

To begin using formality you will need to create a form object.

An example form object can be found here: [Example form object](https://github.com/opr/formality/blob/master/assets/js/react/Formality/Logic/testForm.js)

# Development

- Clone this repo and type `yarn install` on the command line and let it install. If you're not part of the yarn master race feel free to type `npm install`. (If you want to become part of the yarn master race visit [https://yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com) to ascend.)

- On the command line type `yarn run gulp` (from the root of this project) or if you've got gulp installed globally just type `gulp`.

- Connect to `http://localhost:3000` and marvel at Formality rendering before your very eyes.

# Docs
I promise that I'll write these later
